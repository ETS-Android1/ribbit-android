# Ribbit Reference Implementation (Android)
The reference implementation for designing the Android user interface of a broker-dealer trading application with the Alpaca [Broker API](https://alpaca.markets/docs/broker/). The Android user interface is implemented using Java. 

To read more about what Ribbit is, it’s use cases, how it works with Broker API, and more check out our [Ribbit documentation](https://alpaca.markets/docs/broker/ribbit/). 

You can also access the [Ribbit Reference Implementation (Backend)](https://github.com/alpacahq/ribbit-backend) and [Ribbit Reference Implementation (iOS)](https://github.com/alpacahq/ribbit-ios) for a reference implementation of Ribbit’s backend and iOS user interface.

## Caveat
This code is provided as open source for the purpose of demonstration of the Broker API usage. It is not designed for production use and Alpaca does not offer official support of the code available in this repository.

## Overview
